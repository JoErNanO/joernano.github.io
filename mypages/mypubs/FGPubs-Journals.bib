   abstract = {Mobile robots and multimobile robotic system usage for task achievement have been an emerging research area since the last decades. This article presents a review about mobile robot navigation problem and multimobile robotic systems control. The main focus is made on path planning strategies and algorithms in static and dynamic environments. A classification on mobile robots path planning has been defined in the literature and divided to classical and heuristic approaches. Each of them has its own advantages and drawbacks. On the other hand, the control of multimobile robots is presented and the control approaches for a fleet of robots are presented. Scientists found that using more than one robot as opposed to a single one presents many advantages when considering redundant task, dangerous tasks, or a task that scales up or down in time or that requires flexibility. They have defined three main approaches of multiple robots control: behavior-based approach, leader–follower approach, and virtual structure approach. This article addresses these approaches and provides examples from the literature.},

abstract = {During working memory tasks, the hippocampus exhibits synchronous theta-band activity, which is thought to be correlated with the short-term memory maintenance of salient stimuli. Recent studies indicate that the hippocampus contains the necessary circuitry allowing it to generate and sustain theta oscillations without the need of extrinsic drive. However, the cellular and network mechanisms supporting synchronous rhythmic activity are far from being fully understood. Based on electrophysiological recordings from hippocampal pyramidal CA1 cells, we present a possible mechanism for the maintenance of such rhythmic theta-band activity in the isolated hippocampus. Our model network, based on the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism, comprising pyramidal neurons equipped with calcium- activated non-specific cationic (CAN) ion channels, is able to generate and sustain synchronized theta oscillations (4 − 12 Hz), following a transient stimulation. The synchronous network activity is maintained by an intrinsic CAN current (ICAN), in the absence of constant external input. When connecting the pyramidal-CAN network to fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons, the dynamics of the model reveal that feedback inhibition improves the robustness of fast theta oscillations, by tightening the synchronisation of the pyramidal CAN neurons. The frequency and power of the theta oscillations are both modulated by the intensity of the ICAN, which allows for a wide range of oscillation rates within the theta band. This biologically plausible mechanism for the maintenance of synchronous theta oscillations in the hippocampus aims at extending the traditional models of septum-driven hippocampal rhythmic activity.},
